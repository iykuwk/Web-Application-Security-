Design a TryHackMe lesson or lab focusing on an advanced cybersecurity skill, such as SQL Injection, Web Exploitation, or Privilege Escalation. Research the topic thoroughly to ensure that your exercises are challenging, yet accessible for learners with a solid foundation in cybersecurity. Your lab should consist of realistic, hands-on challenges that simulate practical attack and defense techniques. The exercises must require critical thinking and problem-solving skills, encouraging participants to analyze vulnerabilities rather than simply follow step-by-step instructions. Develop a comprehensive guide that includes setup instructions, challenge descriptions, solutions, and practical hints to assist learners without making the exercises too easy. Rigorously test and refine your lab to ensure a balanced difficulty level, adjusting it as needed based on feedback. Once completed, submit a detailed report describing the lesson’s objectives, design process, and expected learning outcomes. The report must explain how your lesson challenges participants and ensures they gain valuable hands-on experience. If the exercises lack depth or fail to challenge learners, the lesson will not be accepted. This task is suitable for cybersecurity practitioners comfortable with designing structured, practical challenges while maintaining a balance between accessibility and complexity.
